# Importing the Cranfield dataset

To import and preprocess the dataset contained in the `data/cran` folder, run the following command:

```bash
python3 import.py
```
It produces the following files: articles, queries, and relevance judgements in pkl format.

Alternatively, you can run the notebook `import.ipynb` version to import the dataset.
