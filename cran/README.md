# Structure of dataset

* cran.all - The documents (1400).
* cran.qry - The queries (365).
* cranqrel - The relevance assesments (for first 225 query). They are in three columns:  $1^{st}$ query number, $2^{nd}$ the relevant document number, and the $3{rd}$ is the relevancy code.
* readme - Some attempt at explanation especially about the relevance judgements.
